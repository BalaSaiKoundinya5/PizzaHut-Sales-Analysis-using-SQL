**Pizza Sales Data Analysis using MS SQL and Excel Dashboard**

**Project Overview**

This project involves a comprehensive analysis of pizza sales data using SQL in MS SQL Server, complemented by a dynamic dashboard created in MS Excel. The project aims to uncover key insights into sales performance, customer behaviour, and product trends by querying and analyzing the data in SQL and then visualizing the results in Excel. This combination of SQL-based analysis and Excel visualization provides a powerful toolset for data-driven decision-making in the pizza business.

**Objective**

The primary objectives of this project are:

1. **Sales Performance:** Analyze total sales, revenue, and profit margins, with a breakdown by pizza type, size, and category.
1. **Customer Insights:** Examine customer ordering patterns, including frequency of purchases, average order values, and key customer segments.
1. **Product Analysis:** Assess the performance of different pizza varieties, identifying best-sellers and underperforming items.
1. **Time-based Analysis:** Explore sales trends over time, such as peak sales periods, daily and weekly patterns, and seasonal variations.
1. **Visual Reporting:** Create an interactive dashboard in MS Excel to present the analyzed data in a user-friendly format for business stakeholders.

**Data Source**

The dataset used for this analysis includes detailed records of pizza sales transactions, with key fields such as:

- **Sales Data:** Information on transaction dates, sales amounts, pizza types, and order quantities.
- **Product Details:** Data on pizza sizes, ingredients, and categories.
- **Customer Information:** Customer demographics, including locations, purchase histories, and order preferences.
- **Time Data:** Records of sales by specific time frames (e.g., hours, days, weeks, months).

**Key Analysis Techniques**

- **SQL Querying:**
  - Writing SQL queries in MS SQL Server to extract, aggregate, and analyze sales data.
- **Data Aggregation:**
  - Using SQL functions like SUM(), AVG(), COUNT(), and GROUP BY to compute sales metrics and performance indicators.
- **Joint Operations:**
  - Combining data from multiple tables using SQL JOIN operations for comprehensive analysis.
- **Time Series Analysis:**
  - Analyzing sales data over different periods to identify trends and seasonality.
- **Data Filtering:**
  - Applying WHERE, HAVING, and ORDER BY clauses in SQL to focus on specific aspects of the data.

**Excel Dashboard Features**

- **Interactive Charts:** Visualization of sales data through bar charts, line graphs, pie charts, and heat maps.
- **Pivot Tables:** Dynamic tables slice and dice the data based on various dimensions such as time, product, and customer segments.
- **Data Slicers:** Tools to filter and drill down into specific data points for detailed analysis.
- **Key Metrics Display:** Highlighting important KPIs such as total revenue, average order value, and top-selling products.

**Tools and Technologies**

- **MS SQL Server:** The primary database management system used for querying and analyzing the pizza sales data.
- **MS SQL:** The SQL language used for data extraction and analysis within MS SQL Server.
- **MS Excel:** Used to create the interactive dashboard and visual reporting of the analyzed data.

**Conclusion**

This project delivers a robust analysis of pizza sales data through MS SQL and an Excel dashboard, offering actionable insights into sales trends, customer behaviour, and product performance. The results provide valuable information that can be used to optimize business strategies, improve inventory management, and enhance customer satisfaction.
